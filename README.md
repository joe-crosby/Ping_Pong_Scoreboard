A basic scoreboard for ping pong.

Click or touch the scoreboard to increase your score. When the number of serves reaches the number of serves selected, the score backgrounds will change. The player with the green background is the user who is currently serving. When one of the scores reaches the winning score, the game is over.

The green background lets the user know who is serving. It will change based on the number of serves selected at the beginning of each game. The default server is Player 1, but can be switched by pressing the "Switch Server" button before each game.

The winning score defaults to 21, but can be switched to 11 for games based on the new rules before each game.
